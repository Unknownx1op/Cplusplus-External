# Cplusplus-External
I was going to say the same thing as in the "Csharp-External" project description, but practically, who doesn't know C# (For it to work First you have to choose an empty project in Visual Studio C++ and then put Release instead of Debug and then go to properties and change C++ Language Standard from C++ 14 to Preview - Features from the Latest C++)
